# CSS Inject

![CSS Inject logo](https://github.com/sym3tri/CSS-Inject/raw/master/icon-128.png)
A Chrome Extension that allows injection of any hosted CSS file into any webpage

## Installation

Just download and install it like any other old chrome extension.

[Download Available in Chrome Extension Gallery](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/fmiohbdblcemacakpnoinjmcelddpjbg)


## Features

* Specify any hosted CSS file to inject (local files must be hosted under http://localhost/ - security restriction of Chrome)
* Single click toggles injection on/off
* Native JavaScript only - no included libraries or unnecessary code to slow you down.

## Why do I want this?

This is to aid in theming websites such as Wordpress or Tumblr.
It's for those cases where you're developing a complex Stylesheet for a site template
but you can't easily update the CSS file on the server.

Using this plug-in: you can work off a localhost hosted CSS file, just hit save, and see the results immediately.
No more copying and pasting, or FTP-ing your CSS up to the server.

Other CSS manipulation plugins only inject their own static css, or make you copy and paste into a box.

I'm sure there's some other use cases too. If you have any, let me know!
